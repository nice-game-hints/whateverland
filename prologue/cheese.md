title: Getting the cheese
order: 20
---

There's a cheese on the table, under the umbrella.

# How to get the cheese?
Have you asked Harold?

You can ask it nicely, if you know who needs the cheese. ^[ Talk to the raven about the rudder, first. ]

Say that you need the cheese for the rudder.

# But I want to steal the cheese!
Then you should say: "None of your business".

# How can I then steal the cheese?
You could use some help. Ask around.

## Who should I ask for help?
Talk to the wardrobe. Say: "Can you help me with something?"

You can now snatch the cheese from the table.

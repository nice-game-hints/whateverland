When [Harold is gone](rudder) you might need to pick the lock in the wardrobe.

# How do I pick the lock?
With the picklock, of course.

## Tell me how
1. Use the rasp to get rid of the screws.
2. Use the x-shaped lockpick to unscrew the small screws.
3. Destroy the green capsule with the hammer lockpick.
4. Use the leftmost lockpick on the rusty slider.
